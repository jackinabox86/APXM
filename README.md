# APXM

A browser extension for [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com) that provides both a mobile-optimised touch interface and an Empire HUD for desktop powered by the [Helm](https://helm.27bit.dev) galaxy map. APXM observes WebSocket traffic and displays your empire status auto-magically.

Part of the [27Bit Industries](https://27bit.dev) tool suite for Prosperous Universe.

## Desktop View

The desktop view embeds a live empire overlay on the Helm galaxy map. Open in APEX with the [rPrUn](https://github.com/refined-prun/refined-prun) XIT WEB command:

```
XIT WEB apxm.27bit.dev
```
Requires APXM extension installed. Without the extension, you'll be directed to a landing page linking to Helm.


### Features

- **Empire overlay** — owned systems highlighted with burn-coloured rings (green/amber/red) on the galaxy map and in system view
- **Live ship tracking** — idle ship and fleet markers at systems, in-transit ships interpolated along flight paths in real time
- **Burn Status Panel** (B key) — per-base burn status, expandable material-level detail, urgency filtering, sort by urgency or system name. Configurable thresholds.
- **Fleet Overview panel** (F key) — all ships with cargo/fuel bars, IDLE/TRANSIT filters, sort by ETA/name/cargo, click-to-zoom into any ship
- **CX Warehouse indicators** — orange dots at CX stations where you have a warehouse, click to open inventory
- **CX Warehouse dropdown** (W key) — quick access to CX warehouse inventories
- **Empire highlight** (E key) — dims the galaxy to highlight only systems where you have bases and nearby CXs
- **Gateway view** (G key) — show/hide gateway indicators and links
- **Base panels** — click any owned planet in system view for production, storage, burn overviews and BS/INV/PROD shortcuts
- **Screen switching** — assign existing APEX screens to planet panels for quick navigation
- **Ship panels** — click any ship for cargo manifest, fuel, flight segment progress and Fly/Cargo/Fuel shortcuts
- **Buffer bridging** — panel buttons open the corresponding APEX buffer directly (BS, INV, PROD, SHP, CXM, FLT etc.)
- **Theme picker** — five Helm colour themes, including Colorblind mode
- **rprun detection** — detects Refined PrUn and offers ACTS button integration (can be disabled)

### Keyboard shortcuts

## Mobile View

### Features

Overlays the APEX mobile interface with a touch-focused UI while the underlying game client keeps running.

- **Status Dashboard** — at-a-glance summaries of bases, fleet and contracts. Drill-down to full views.
- **Burn tracking** — per-site material burn rates with urgency indicators (critical/warning/ok). Purchase need calculation with resupply targets. Configurable thresholds.
- **Fleet overview** — ship status, destinations, ETA countdowns.
- **Contract monitoring** — active contracts with condition status and deadlines.
- **FIO integration** — auto-fetches data from the FIO REST API on startup if credentials are configured.
- **Buffer refresh** — per-site data refresh without switching back to APEX.

## Technical Stuff

APXM intercepts the WebSocket connection between APEX and the game server using a main-world content script injected before Prun loads. Messages are decoded through Socket.IO's double-encoding layer (engine.io + socket.io framing) and fed into typed Zustand stores. The React UI (mobile) and postMessage bridge (desktop) render from those stores.

The interception and message bus code lives in the shared [@prun/link](https://github.com/Zillatron27/PrUn-Link) library.

```
APEX <-> Game Server (WebSocket/Socket.IO)
          | (observed, never modified)
     @prun/link decoder
          |
     Zustand stores
          |
     ├── APXM React UI (mobile)
     └── postMessage bridge → Helm shell (desktop)
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Browser | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| iOS / iPadOS | Orion (Kagi) | Validated |
| Android | Firefox | TBA |
| Android | Kiwi Browser | TBA |
| Desktop | Chrome / Firefox | Desktop view active, mobile view can be enabled with `?apxm_force` |

## Install

Firefox: [Firefox Add-ons (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/apxm/).

Chrome: available soon on the Chrome Web Store.

## Build From Source

Requires Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10+.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build            # Chrome MV3 -> .output/chrome-mv3/
pnpm run build:firefox    # Firefox MV2 -> .output/firefox-mv2/
pnpm run test             # Run test suite (303 tests)
```

`@prun/link` is a private dependency pulled from GitHub. Local development uses
SSH (your usual `~/.ssh/config`). In sandboxed environments without SSH
(CI runners, Claude Code on the web, etc.) expose a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with read
access to `Zillatron27/PrUn-Link` and use the bundled
`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` — it rewrites the dep URL to authenticated
HTTPS and then runs `pnpm install`. Wire it up by adding the following to
your personal `.claude/settings.json` (or your `context/` repo's copy of it,
since this repo's `settings.json` is gitignored):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm run dev              # Chrome with hot reload
pnpm run dev:firefox      # Firefox with hot reload
```

### Desktop Shell (apxm.27bit.dev)

The desktop view shell page is a separate Vite app deployed to Cloudflare:

```bash
cd shell
pnpm install
pnpm run build            # Build to shell/dist/
npx wrangler deploy       # Deploy to Cloudflare
```

### Package for Distribution

```bash
pnpm run zip              # Chrome zip
pnpm run zip:firefox      # Firefox zip + sources zip (for AMO)
```

## Acknowledgments

APXM is inspired by and built on the shoulders of giants — it wouldn't exist without the work that came before it.

**[Refined PrUn (rprun)](https://github.com/refined-prun/refined-prun)** — APXM's understanding of APEX's internal message protocol, DOM structure, and buffer management draws from rprun's prior work.

**[FIO (Prosperous Universe Community API)](https://doc.fnar.net)** — FIO provides the game data (materials, buildings, recipes, planet data, exchange prices) that makes tools like APXM, Helm and others possible.
